### Docker examples
The project is used for me to learn how to use docker for development. The aim is to sucessfully combine Docker, PHP-fpm and Nginx. It still lacks the MySQL part :)

+ Directory **nginx_html** is about Docker+Nginx+Html

+ Directory **php** is about Docker+PHP-cli+php

+ Directory **laravel** is to finally combine Docker+PHP-fpm+Nginx

The plus point of learning how to use docker with php is, it helps me understand deeperly about how php-fpm and nginx work together.
